    "\n",
    "In this project you will design a Python class to represent the well\\-formed formulas \\(WFFs\\) covered in MATH0005 Algebra 1. You will write class methods that evaluate a WFF at a given truth assignment and that produce a string representation of a WFF suitable for use with the Python `print` function.  You will also write a functions for checking logical equivalences between WFFs represented by instances of your class. Finally, you will write a _parser_ which takes a WFF represented by a Python string, like `\"((¬p ∧ q) ∨ ((r ∧ ¬q) → p))\"`, as input and returns the corresponding object of your WFF class.\n",

    "## Part 1 - the WFF class and subclasses\n",
    "\n",
    "Often when we write classes we come across a situation where one type of object is a special kind of another type. For example, we might have a class `Person` representing people and a class `Student` representing students. Every student is also a person, so every `Student` object should also be a `Person` and be able to do everything a `Person` can do. We say that the class `Student` is a *subclass* of `Person` and that the `Student` should *inherit* the methods and instance variables from `Person`.  To make this happen we define the `Person` class as usual and then do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Student(Person):\n",
    "    # class definition goes here\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing `Student(Person)` ensures that a `Student` is a special kind of `Person` and that an instance of the `Student` class will be able to use any methods and access any instance variables defined in `Person`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Algebra 1 you saw that there were five different kinds of WFF:\n",
    "\n",
    " - (0) a propositional variable\n",
    " - (1) a WFF of the form $\\neg \\phi$, where $\\phi$ is a WFF\n",
    " - (2) a WFF of the form $(\\phi \\vee \\psi)$, where $\\phi$ and $\\psi$ are WFFs\n",
    " - (3) a WFF of the form $(\\phi \\wedge \\psi)$, where $\\phi$ and $\\psi$ are WFFs\n",
    " - (4) a WFF of the form $(\\phi \\implies \\psi)$, where $\\phi$ and $\\psi$ are WFFs\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these is a \"special kind of WFF\", so we will use a single class `WFF` with five subclasses `PropVarWFF`, `NotWFF`, `AndWFF`, `OrWFF`, and `ImpliesWFF` to represent our formulas.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The classes `AndWFF`, `OrWFF`, and `ImpliesWFF` will each have two instance variables `left` and `right` which represent the WFFs on the left and the right of the connective. As an example, given two `WFF`s `phi` and `psi` (of any kind) people using the class must be able to create an `AndWFF` that represents `(phi ∧ psi)` by calling `AndWFF(phi, psi)`, which should set the `left` instance variable of the `AndWFF` object to `phi` and the `right` instance variable to `psi`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The class `NotWFF` should have a single instance variable `formula`, which will be a `WFF` of any kind. `NotWFF(formula)` will represent `¬ formula`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The class `PropVarWFF` will have a single instance variable `name`, which will be a string. `PropVarWFF(\"p\")`, for example, will represent a WFF which is a propositional variable called `p`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Write the `__init__` method for each of these five classes in the code cells below**.  Don't make any changes to the `WFF` class itself yet.  I have written the `__init__` function for `AndWFF` for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the moment these classes won't do anything at all (in fact, trying to run the cells will give an error because the class bodies are empty). We will add functionality in the next three parts.\n",

    "## Part 2 - implementing `__str__(self)`\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part your task is to **write an `__str__(self)` method for each of the five classes `PropVarWFF`, `NotWFF`, `AndWFF`, `OrWFF`, and `ImpliesWFF`**.  You must put your code in the cells above where you wrote the `__init__` methods.  Don't copy the class definitions into a different cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that `__str__(self)` must return a string representing `self`, and that once a class has an `__str__(self)` method, `print`ing an instance of that class will display the string produced by `__str__`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Writing the `__str__(self)` method for the `PropVarWFF` class will be easy since it already has the name of the propositional variable as an instance variable.  It just needs to return the instance variable `self.name`.  On the other hand the `__str__(self)` method of the `NotWFF` class should print out a `¬` symbol and then the string representation of the `formula` instance variable, so you will have to call the `__str__` method of `self.formula`. Recall that you can join two strings together with `+`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other three classes are similar to `NotWFF` in that you will have to call the `__str__` method of the two instance variables `self.left` and `self.right`, and combine these with brackets and the symbol for the relevant logical connective.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can copy and paste the following symbols: ¬ ∨ ∧ ⇒ for use in your implementations of `__str__`.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have included some test cases below followed by a comment specifying the correct output. **Your code must give the correct output in each of these cases** although you will not lose marks for having more or less spaces in your output. Please remember that just because your implementations of `__str__` work for these cases does not mean that they work for *any* WFF, and to get full marks your code must be correct in general.  You may want to add further tests to see if your code works for other WFFs.\n",

    "where $\\phi$ and $\\psi$ are smaller WFFs.  The *last* connective used when constructing a WFF using a sequence of these rules is called its *principal connective*, so in a formula of type 4 like ((¬p ∨ q) ⇒ r), the principle connective is the ⇒, in the type 2 formula ((p ∨ q) **∨** (r ∧ (p ∨ p))), the principal connective is the bold **∨**, and in ¬(¬p ∨ q) the principal connective is the leftmost ¬.\n",
    "\n",
    "That means our `parse` function can do the following.  \n",
    "\n",
    " - If the input has length 0, it does not represent a valid WFF so `parse` should raise an error.\n",
    " - If the input has length 1, it consists of a single character.  Either that character is a lower case English letter e.g. `p` in which case `parse` should return `PropVarWFF(\"p\")`, or it is some another character in which case `parse` should raise an error.\n",
    "  - If the input `s` has length longer than 1, it must, if it is valid, represent a WFF of one of the four types listed above.  For example, if `s` is of the first type, it must start with the symbol `¬` and then the remainder `s[1:]` (this is a *slice* of a string - look up the syntax in the weekly notebooks if you don't remember how it works) of the string will be another valid WFF, so `parse` can return `NotWFF(parse(s[1:])`.  The parse function will therefore call itself - a parser that does this is called *recursive*.  On the other hand, if `s` is of the second type, it must consist of an open bracket, then a string representing a WFF, then the principal connective ∨, then a string representing another WFF, then a close bracket. The parser should therefore return `OrWFF(parse(s[?:?]), parse[?:?])` where the ? are chosen so that the parse function is called on the two WFFs being connected by the principal ∨.  WFFs of types 3 and 4 can be done similarly.\n",
    "\n",
    "You're nearly ready to write `parse(s)` now, but there's still one major problem.  If `s` is a valid WFF with more than one character, it must be of one of the four types above.  How can we figure out which of the four types it is, and locate the principal connective?  This is easy for type 1: we just have to check if the first character of the string is a ¬.  For the others, you can use the following technique.  Suppose `s` is a string of length greater than 1 which is a valid WFF and that it does not start with ¬.  Read through `s` from left to right, starting at position 0, keeping a \"bracket count.\"  Every time an open bracket appears, increase the bracket count by 1.  Every time a close bracket appears, decrease the bracket count by 1.  It is then a theorem that there is a unique connective that occurs at a point in the string where the bracket count is 1, and this is the principal connective.  (You can try and prove this if you like, but you don't need to do that for the project).  Here are two examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "string:        ( ( ¬ p ∨ q ) ⇒ r )\n",
    "bracket count: 1 2 2 2 2 2 1 1  1 0\n",
    "\n",
    "string:        ( ( p ∨ q ) ∨ ( r ∧ ( p ∨ p ) ) )\n",
    "bracket count: 1 2 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 2 1 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In both cases there is a unique connective which occurs when the bracket count is 1, and that connective is the principal connective.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, here's how `parse(s)` will work.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. remove any spaces from `s`\n",
    "2. if the length of `s` is 0, raise an error\n",
    "3. if the length of `s` is 1, either return an appropriate `PropVarWFF` (if `s` is a letter) or otherwise raise an error\n",
    "4. if the first character of `s` is a ¬, return `NotWFF(parse(s[1:])`\n",
    "5. otherwise, try to locate the principal connective using the bracket count method.  If you find a connective with bracket count 1 and it was ∨, for example, then return `OrWFF(parse(s[?:?]), parse[?:?])` with the ? filled in correctly.\n",
    "6. if you didn't find a connective with bracket count 1 then `s` is not a WFF, so raise an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have written the outline of the function for you below.  Complete it and then use the cells after to test it.\n",
